    <p>Natural Language Processing is a branch of Machine Learning that uses human language to communicate with the computers. NLP has a vast number of uses in different fields, e.g.-
        <ul>
            <li>Text recognition</li>
            <li>Text to speech</li>
            <li>Speech to text</li>
        </ul>
        and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        NLP has to do three things:-
        <ol>
            <li>Recognise</li>
            <li>Interpret</li>
            <li>Generate</li>
        </ol>
        In python we there are two libraries that are generally used for NLP, i.e., NLTK and SpaCy.
        <br><br>
        The difference between the two could be best understood by considering NLTK as DSLR, meaning it is filled with algorithms and is very professional, on the other hand SpaCy is more of a phone camera.
    </p>
    <p>There are some ways to do NLP:-
        <ul>
            <li>Tokenization- Breaking down text into individual words or sentences.</li>
            <li>Stemming- Reducing words to their base or root form. This helps in simplifying the analysis of words with similar meanings.</li>
            <li>Tagging- Assigning grammatical tags to words, such as identifying parts of speech.</li>
            <li>Parsing- Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences. Parsing refers to the process of analyzing the grammatical structre of a sentence in order to understand its syntax. This involves breaking down the sentence into its components.</li>
            <li>Named Entity recognition(NER)- Identifying and classifying entities in text. It just identifies the words and puts them into different categories.</li>
            <li>Frequency Distribution</li>
            <li>Concordance</li>
            <li>WordNet Interface</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Tokenization</h2>
    <p>Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller unitsm such as words or sentences. These smaller units are called tokens. Tokenization is a findamental step in natural language processing (NLP) abd text analysis.

    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
    <p>
        Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match, search, and manipulate strings. They are commonly used in programming and text processing for tasks like validation, extraction, and replacement.

    <h2>Stop Words</h2>
    <p>
        Stop words are common words that are often considered to be of little value in text analysis because they occur frequently in the language and typically do not carry much meaning on their own. Examples of stop words include articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and other common words that are necessary for constructing grammatically correct sentences but may not contribute much to the meaning of the text.
        <br>
        Removing stop words is a common preprocessing step in NLP to improve the efficency of text analysis and reduce the dimensionality of the data. NLTK in Python provides a list of common stop words that can be used for this purpose.
